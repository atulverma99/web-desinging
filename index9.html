9.Embed Audio and Video into your HTML web page.
The <video> element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really simple example looks like this:
<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
